# LightMotor
LightMotor is a university project for Event Driven Applications course.
 
It consists of 3 parts:
- Windows Forms (By Oct. 22.) -- MVP (Model-View-Persistence)
- WPF (By Nov. 19.) -- MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) with added Persistence
- MAUI (By Dec. 10.) -- MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) with added Persistence

The aim is to use different architecture styles across all three projects.

In this simplistic game, two players compete against each other, creating luminous trails with their motorcycles. The first player to collide with either the wall or a light trail loses.
